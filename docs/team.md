# Current team members

This page lists (alphabetically) the officially named Jupyter Notebook Team.

## Active members

Active team members are actively participating in the development, maintenance, planning, and discussion around projects in the Jupyter Notebook Github organization.

```{eval-rst}

```

## Inactive members

Inactive team members are (temporarily or not) pausing their active participation in the Jupyter Notebook community. They can reactivate themselves at any point in the future; it does not require a nomination by a current active member.

```{eval-rst}

.. include:: team/inactive.txt

```

## Software Steering Council Representative

Each *official* subproject in Jupyter gets a single [Software Steering Council Representative](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_steering_council.html#software-steering-council). Jupyter Notebook's representative is elected by the active team members. This representative *should* be re-elected every year (i.e. in January).

(Jupyter Notebook's representative hasn't been nominated yet).
